There are many different types of objects in Python. Let's start with the most common object types: <i>strings</i>, <i>integers</i> and <i>floats</i>. Anytime you write words (text) in Python, you're using <i>character strings</i> (strings for short). The most common numbers, on the other hand, are <i>integers</i> (e.g. -1, 0, 100) and <i>floats</i>, which represent real numbers (e.g. 3.14, -42.0).</p>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"luVDp4D3EwrQ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<a align=\"center\">\n","    <img src=\"https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Chapter%201/Images/TypesObjects.png\" width=\"600\">\n","</a>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pn6HEQaeEwrR","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<p>The following code cells contain some examples.</p>\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Kd2iA6O9EwrR","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599944228567,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":916,"user":{"displayName":"Mattia Da Campo","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgHCx2FA-aMR-8laY6pczGWwsF1_R7GpZDFdUhrig=s64","userId":"10967808262973799480"}},"outputId":"dd381804-114b-420e-8ca2-6eafbb3e9d62"},"source":["# Integer\n","\n","11"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["11"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qlcEjHN8EwrT","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599944231388,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":689,"user":{"displayName":"Mattia Da Campo","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgHCx2FA-aMR-8laY6pczGWwsF1_R7GpZDFdUhrig=s64","userId":"10967808262973799480"}},"outputId":"e7501899-58fb-435a-92da-c3f82206db93"},"source":["# Float\n","\n","2.14"],"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["2.14"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"BuiZl2lWEwrU","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599944234544,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1067,"user":{"displayName":"Mattia Da Campo","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgHCx2FA-aMR-8laY6pczGWwsF1_R7GpZDFdUhrig=s64","userId":"10967808262973799480"}},"outputId":"6348faca-153b-483d-b0bb-9583565cdfbd"},"source":["# String\n","\n","\"Hello, Python 101!\""],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'Hello, Python 101!'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"x_szL5hwEwrW","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<p>You can get Python to tell you the type of an expression by using the built-in <code>type()</code> function.

By sharing your notebook on GitHub you are not only building your reputation with fellow data scientists, but you can also show it off when applying for a job. Even though this was your first piece of work, it is never too early to start building good habits.
